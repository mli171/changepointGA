\title{Calculating BIC for Multiple changepoint detection with model order selection}
\usage{
ARIMA.BIC.Order(chromosome, plen = 2, XMat, Xt)
}
\arguments{
\item{chromosome}{A vector consists of the number of changepoints, the order 
of AR component (refers to the number of lagged terms used to model the 
current value of a time series), the order of MA component (refers to the 
number of lagged error terms used to model the current value of a time 
series), the changepoint locations, and a value of time series sample size 
plus 1 ($N+1$) indicating the end of the chromosome.}

\item{plen}{The number of model order parameters that need to be selected.
If model order selection needs to be performed simultaneously with the
changepoint detection task, \code{plen} should be nonzero.}

\item{XMat}{A matrix contains the covariates, but not includes changepoint
effects, for time series regression.}

\item{Xt}{The simulated ARMA time series from \code{ts.sim} function.}
}
\value{
The BIC value of the objective function.
}
\description{
The objective function for changepoint search in Autoregressive
moving average with model order selection via Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC).

\examples{
N = 1000
XMatT = matrix(1, nrow=N, ncol=1)
Xt = ts.sim(beta=0.5, XMat=XMatT, sigma=1, phi=0.5, theta=0.8,
            Delta=c(2, -2), CpLoc=c(250, 750), seed=1234)

# one chromosome representation
chromosome = c(2, 1, 1, 250, 750, 1001)
