\title{Comparing multiple changepoint configurations by pairwise distance}
\usage{
cptDist(tau1, tau2, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{tau1}{A vector contains the changepoint locations for \eqn{C_{1}}
for comparison. A value \code{NULL} is required if there is no changepoint detected.}

\item{tau2}{A vector contains the changepoint locations for  \eqn{C_{2}}
for comparison. A value \code{NULL} is required if there is no changepoint detected.}

\item{N}{The simulated time series sample size. Two changepoint configurations
should have the same \eqn{n} values.}
}
\value{
\item{dist}{The calculated distance.}
}
\description{
This function is to calculate the distance metric (Shi et al., 2022) between
two changepoint configurations, \eqn{C_{1}=\{\tau_{1}, \ldots, \tau_{m}\}}
and \eqn{C_{2}=\{\eta_{1}, \ldots, \eta_{k}\}}, where \eqn{\tau}'s are the
changepoint locations.
}
\details{
The pairwise distance was proposed by Shi et al. (2022),
\deqn{d(C_{1}, C_{2})=|m-k|+ \min(A(C_{1}, C_{2})),}
where \eqn{m} is the number of changepoints in configuration \eqn{C_{1}} and
\eqn{k} is the number of changepoints in configuration \eqn{C_{2}}.
The term \eqn{\min(A(C_{1}, C_{2}))} reflects the cost of matching
changepoint locations between \eqn{C_{1}} and \eqn{C_{2}} and can be calculated
using the linear assignment method. Details can be found in Shi et al. (2022).
Note: if one configuration doesn't contain any changepoints (valued \code{NULL}),
the distance is defined as \eqn{|m-k|}. The function can also be used
to examine changepoint detection performance in simulation studies. Given the
true changepoint configuration, \eqn{C_{true}}, used in generating the time
series, the calculated distance between the estimated multiple changepoint
configuration, \eqn{C_{est}=\{\eta_{1}, \ldots, \eta_{k}\}}, and \eqn{C_{true}}
can be used to evaluate the performance of the detection algorithm.

\examples{
N <- 100

# both tau1 and tau2 has detected changepoints
tau2 <- c(25, 50, 75)
tau1 <- c(20, 35, 70, 80, 90)
cptDist(tau1 = tau1, tau2 = tau2, N = N)

# either tau1 or tau2 has zero detected changepoints
cptDist(tau1 = tau1, tau2 = NULL, N = N)
cptDist(tau1 = NULL, tau2 = tau2, N = N)

# both tau1 and tau2 has zero detected changepoints
cptDist(tau1 = NULL, tau2 = NULL, N = N)
