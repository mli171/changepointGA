\title{Plot Time Series with Detected Changepoints from a `cptgaisl` Object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cptgaisl}(x, data, ..., main = NULL, LegendPos = "topright")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{cptgaisl}, typically returned by a Island GA based
changepoint detection procedure.}

\item{data}{A numeric vector representing the observed univariate time series.}

\item{...}{Additional optional graphical arguments, including:
\itemize{
  \item \code{XTickLab}: Optional numeric or date vector for custom x-axis labels. Must be the same length as \code{data}.
  \item \code{XTickPos}: Optional vector of positions on the x-axis where tick marks should appear.
  \item \code{XAxisLab}, \code{YAxisLab}: Optional character strings for x-axis and y-axis labels.
}}

\item{main}{Optional main title for the plot.}

\item{LegendPos}{Character string indicating the position of the legend.
Accepts standard legend positions such as \code{"topright"}, \code{"bottom"},
\code{"topleft"}, etc. Default is \code{"topright"}.}
}
\value{
A time series plot is displayed. The function returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function visualizes a univariate time series along with the changepoints
identified by a Island model Genetic Algorithm, as represented by a `cptgaisl` object. Vertical
dashed lines mark changepoint locations, and segment means are shown as horizontal
dashed lines. A legend summarizes the optimal fitness value and changepoint locations.
}
\details{
If \code{XTickLab} is supplied and matches the length of \code{data}, it is used for the x-axis;
otherwise, the default \code{1:length(data)} is used.

If the GA was run with \code{option = "both"}, the function adjusts the changepoint indices
to skip over model hyperparameters in the chromosome.

The plot legend reports the optimal fitness value and changepoint locations (transformed
by \code{XTickLab} if applicable). The y-axis is extended slightly to make room for the legend.
